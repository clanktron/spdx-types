# SPDX Types

Typing for SPDX json representations.

Type definitions are directly generated with [`json2ts`](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) from the schemas published with each release of the [SPDX spec](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec).

Currently only versions 2.2 and 2.3 supported, with the most recent patch version being used for each.
